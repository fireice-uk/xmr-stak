/*
 * GPU configuration. You should play around with intensity and worksize as the fastest settings will vary.
 * index         - GPU index number usually starts from 0
 * intensity     - Number of parallel GPU threads (nothing to do with CPU threads)
 * worksize      - Number of local GPU threads (nothing to do with CPU threads)
 * affine_to_cpu - This will affine the thread to a CPU. This can make a GPU miner play along nicer with a CPU miner.
 * strided_index - switch memory pattern used for the scratch pad memory
 *                 3 = chunked memory, chunk size based on the 'worksize'
 *                     required: intensity must be a multiple of worksize
 *                 2 = chunked memory, chunk size is controlled by 'mem_chunk'
 *                     required: intensity must be a multiple of worksize
 *                 1 or true  = use 16byte contiguous memory per thread, the next memory block has offset of intensity blocks
 *                             (for cryptonight_v8 and monero it is equal to strided_index = 0)
 *                 0 or false = use a contiguous block of memory per thread
 * mem_chunk     - range 0 to 18: set the number of elements (16byte) per chunk
 *                 this value is only used if 'strided_index' == 2
 *                 element count is computed with the equation: 2 to the power of 'mem_chunk' e.g. 4 means a chunk of 16 elements(256byte)
 * unroll        - allow to control how often the POW main loop is unrolled; valid range [1;128) - for most OpenCL implementations it must be a power of two.
 * comp_mode     - Compatibility enable/disable the automatic guard around compute kernel which allows
 *                 to use a intensity which is not the multiple of the worksize.
 *                 If you set false and the intensity is not multiple of the worksize the miner can crash:
 *                 in this case set the intensity to a multiple of the worksize or activate comp_mode.
 * interleave    - Controls the starting point in time between two threads on the same GPU device relative to the last started thread.
 *                 This option has only an effect if two compute threads using the same GPU device: valid range [0;100]
 *                 0  = disable thread interleaving
 *                 40 = each working thread waits until 40% of the hash calculation of the previous started thread is finished
